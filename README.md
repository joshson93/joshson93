 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Son!
 
 👀 I’m interested in learning all the different JavaScript frameworks and libraries in order to create beautiful websites (React will always have a place in my heart).
 
 🌱 I’m currently a full stack/software engineer (with a bias to front end development) who is devoted and passionate about learning and building useful and aesthetically pleasing websites/applications.
